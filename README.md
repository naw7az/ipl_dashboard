#### The Deployed Version of the app is [here](https://ipl-dash.web.app/).



### List of all the Libraries/Frameworks used to create this projects.

1. **Pandas and Numpy**.

   - To maipulate the given data and create a new dataframe with all the information needed specifically for the project.

2. **Node.js**

   - The Javascript runtime environment is used to have all the required libraries for front end development.

3. **React.js**

   - The front end Javascript framework used to make this project. I don't Know vue.js but I am ready to learn anytime. :)
   
4. **Material UI**
   
   - Almost everything in this project is displayed inside a Card component which is imported from Material UI.
   
5. **Chart.js**
   
   - To give a visual representation of the data to the user which provides a better user experience and understanding.
   
   
   
### Bonus Points.

1. **Loading Time Optimization**.

   - After the completion of the project, I ran the project in the production server(optimized server) and saved all the data in a file.
   - The project is hosted in [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which provides loading time optimization to the project when it is hosted.

2. **Mobile Responsive**

   - The project is made to run and have a good user experience in both desktop and mobiles.
   - I used [Media Query](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) to make the web app responsive.

3. **Offline usable**

   - All the data used in the project are stored in a folder and I am not using API request so that the project will run offline as well.
  
  
  
### General Setup

1. **Fork and clone the project**.

   - If you are fairly new to Github or Git, please checkout the [**official Github Guide!**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

2. **Use your favorite text editor**

   - Personally I use VScode. You are welcome to use any of your preferences!

3. **From the root directory of the project, install dependencies with npm**

4. ```javascript
   npm install    // install dependencies for project
   ```
5. Play with any of the available scripts given below.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
